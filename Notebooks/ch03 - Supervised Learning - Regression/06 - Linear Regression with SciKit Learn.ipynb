    "## What is Linear Regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** is about finding the line of best fit through many points on a chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a **Linear Regression** alogorithm we're looking for the best straight line **straight line** through the points. If the relationship between your data are not a straight line, you may need to use a different algorithm such as logistic regression or nonlinear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression should be familar to you. You'll probably recall gathering data and plotting charts in GCSE Science experiments? You might have collected 10 readings in a double period, but by drawing a line of best fit you'd be able to infer what the data at other points might be. i.e. you'd be able to predict what other values might be along the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Best Fit](../../Images/best-fit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, we refer to the data along the X axis as a \"feature\" and the data along the y axis as the \"target variable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In GCSE Science you'd have called the variable on the X axis the \"independent variable\", although we'll call it a feature. And, you'd have called the variable on the Y axis the \"dependent variable\", but we'll call it the \"target variable\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this means you were generally dealing with 2 columns of data at GCSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress through this course, you'll eventually use more complex data that has additional columns of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning you can have as many columns of input data (features) as you like, but you can only have one output variable, i.e one target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on **Simple Linear Regression** i.e. we'll find a straight line of best fit for 2 columns of data (one feature and a target variable). "
