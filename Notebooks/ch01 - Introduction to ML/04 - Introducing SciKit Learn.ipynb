    "It brings together a wide range of Machine Learning Libraries into one, easy to use, and well documented toolkit. \n",

    "The https://scikit-learn.org/ webpage splits the SciKit Learn functionality into 6 categories. I've given each a number (see annotations in pink).\n",

    "\n",
    "It's easy to get Classification and Clustering confused. Classification tries to divvy up observations by identifiying the boundary lines between classes. Clusters are based on each observation's proximity to a centroid. \n",
